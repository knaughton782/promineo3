		 * 	2) what the method does; 
		 * 	3) and why would it be useful/how could it be used.
		 * 
		 * NOTE: In the Java programming language, a method signature
		 * is the method name and the number, type and order of its parameters.

		 * String: 5 methods
		 * 1.1) public String concat (String str)
		 * 1.2) This method concatenates the specified string to the end of the string variable
		 * 1.3) This would be useful for updating String contents, for example: taking user input
		 * 			for first name and last name to display as one field rather than two.
		 *  
		 * 2.1) public String toLowerCase()
		 * 2.2) This method converts all the characters of a String to lower case
		 * 2.3) This is useful when analyzing/storing usernames to ensure everything matches
		 * 
		 * 3.1) public String toUpperCase
		 * 3.2) This method converts all the characters in this String to uppercase
		 * 3.3) This method can be used when you need things to be in uppercase
		 * 
		 * 4.1) public String toString()
		 * 4.2) This returns a string.
		 * 4.3) When you need to verify that input or data is used as a String
		 * 
		 * 5.1) public static String format(String format, Object... args)
		 * 5.2) This returns a formatted string using the specified format and arguments.
		 * 5.3) Useful for having data returned or displayed in a specific format, like a telephone number.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Array: 5 methods
		 * 1.1) public static void sort(int[] a)
		 * 1.2) This sorts the array into ascending numerical order
		 * 1.3) Useful when numbers need to be in order
		 * 
		 * 2.1) public static boolean equals(int[] a, int[] a2)
		 * 2.2) This returns true if the two arrays are equal
		 * 2.3) Equality is often used for logic statements and decision making
		 * 
		 * 3.1) public static void fill(int[] a, int value)
		 * 3.2) This assigns the specified int value to each element of the specified array
		 * 3.3) This would allow you to dynamically populate your array with specified info
		 * 
		 * 4.1) public static String toString(int[] a)
		 * 4.2) This returns a string representation of your array
		 * 4.3) This would be valuable when you need to be working with a string
		 * 
		 * 5.1) public static int hashCode(int[] a)
		 * 5.2) Returns a hashcode based on the contents of the array
		 * 5.3) There are times when you need to identify data and a hashcode is a way of identifying
		 * 		or indexing the data in the array
