	 * Scanner is good as a global or class variable. More of these will come up 
	 * when we cover object oriented programming.
	 * 
	 * Semi colons only at the end of statements: code that does something
	 * Practice writing for loops, enhanced for loops, while loops.
	 * 
	 *Methods return something and storing information is lists or arrays.
	 *
	 *Once a method returns a value, the method is exited.
	 *
	 *add the string to itself (+=)....create new string....
	 *
